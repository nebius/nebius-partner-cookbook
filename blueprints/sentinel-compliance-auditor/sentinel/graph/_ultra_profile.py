"""Built-in NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Ultra harness profile.

VENDORED from deepagents PR #4192 (commit 9cde961), not yet released. Kept
verbatim except for the `build_nemotron_ultra_profile()` factor-out so Sentinel
can register the profile under its ChatNebius `nebius:<id>` key. Re-sync from
upstream once the PR merges and `deepagents` is bumped.


Registers a `HarnessProfile` for NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Ultra
(`nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b`) that pairs a behavior-shaping
`system_prompt_suffix` with three middleware:

- `NemotronToolMessageShim`: `ChatNVIDIA`'s payload builder rejects a `role="tool"`
  message whose content normalizes to null (an empty string collapses to null),
  so an empty tool result crashes the run. The shim coerces empty/None tool
  content to a non-empty placeholder. It is a no-op on non-empty results.
- `ReadFileContinuationNoticeMiddleware`: the `read_file` line-limit path returns
  exactly `limit` lines with no truncation signal (the truncation message only
  fires on the token-size path), so the model can assume it has seen the whole
  file. This appends an in-result continuation notice.
- `ToolRetryMiddleware` (stock LangChain): retries a failed filesystem tool call
  once.

Per-model keys (not the `"NVIDIA"`/`"nvidia"` provider prefix) keep other
NVIDIA-catalog models unchanged. Both provider casings are registered: a
`ChatNVIDIA` instance resolves to `NVIDIA:<id>` (its LangSmith provider is
capitalized) while an `init_chat_model("nvidia:...")` spec resolves to
`nvidia:<id>`.

_SYSTEM_PROMPT_SUFFIX: str = """<approach>
Plan briefly before acting. When several reads or lookups are independent, issue them as parallel tool calls rather than one at a time.
</approach>

<grounding>
Verify state with tools instead of recalling it: read a file before describing it, run a check before claiming a result. After each tool result, reflect briefly before choosing the next action.
</grounding>

<completion>
Do only what the task requires, then stop and give a concise final answer.
</completion>

<clarification>
When a data-analysis request is underspecified, ask for both missing dimensions before proceeding:
1. the data source or data itself, such as a file path, pasted data, dataset, or database connection;
2. the analysis goal or type, such as summary statistics, trends, anomalies, comparisons, segments, forecasts, or a specific question to answer.
</clarification>

<minimal_followups>
Ask only for missing information. Do not ask for details the user already supplied; treat explicit cadence, recipients, data, or destination as known and avoid re-asking for them.
</minimal_followups>

<context_compaction>
If a long conversation switches to a completely unrelated new task and the compact_conversation tool is available, call compact_conversation before starting the new task.
</context_compaction>

<final_answer_completeness>
After tool calls succeed, the final answer must report the concrete result, not just that the task is done. Include the key entity, action, identifier, title, recipient, service, status, or value that answers the user's request. If the user asked multiple questions, answer each one from its matching tool output; do not substitute an entity from a different subtask.
</final_answer_completeness>

<followup_defaults>
Ask follow-up questions only for information needed to proceed safely or correctly. Do not re-ask for constraints the user already gave.

When the user asks broadly for a summary, report, analysis, review, or search over available items, assume the broad scope unless they mention a filter; ask only about output format, level of detail, destination, or unavailable access.

When the user asks for a recurring task and gives a recurrence such as daily, weekly, monthly, or every N days, treat that as enough cadence and do not ask for day, time, timezone, or cadence again unless scheduling cannot proceed without it.

When advising on an operational workflow, support process, automation, or routing setup, ask what product, domain, or workflow is being supported if that context is missing.
